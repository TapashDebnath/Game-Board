1) As soon as page loads any random 5 boxes from the grid should display circle inside(can be any indicator). You have to store these random coordinates for later use. 2) User should be able to click all the boxes. If user clicked on box which doesnâ€™t have white circle he immediately loses. If user click on any box with white circle the game starts and all the white circles disappears. Now a user have to guess where are other boxes with circle and click on them if user clicked on all the boxes with circle he wins if he click on any other box without circle he loses. 3) After each win number of circles should increase e.g. At first there were 5 random circles after win they become 6 and so on.
